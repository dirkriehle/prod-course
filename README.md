# Software Product Management (by Case)

This course teaches students software product management using the case method. If you are new to the concept of teaching cases, please read the case method explained first: http://dirkriehle.com/open-courses/software-product-management/the-case-method-explained/

The lecture slides provided in this project provide an abridged introduction to software product management; the bulk of the learning is done using the teaching cases. The teaching cases themselves come without source code and without example solution; those are only available to lecturers.
